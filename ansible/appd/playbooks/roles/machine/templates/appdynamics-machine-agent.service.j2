Description=AppDynamics Machine Agent

[Service]

# The AppDynamics machine agent startup script does not fork a process, so
# this is a simple service.
# Note: If you are changing the User running the machine agent, you must also ensure
# that the desired user has read access to controller-info.xml as well as write access
# to the log file. You can change specific file permissions or, most simply, do a
# chown command to give the desired user ownership of the MACHINE_AGENT_HOME directory.

Type=simple

Environment=MACHINE_AGENT_HOME={{ machine_agent_dest_folder_linux }}
Environment=JAVA_HOME={{ machine_agent_dest_folder_linux }}/jre

# Specify agent system properties for systemd here by setting or editing JAVA_OPTS, e.g.,
#Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-D<sys-property1>=<value1> -D<sys-property2>=<value2>"

Environment="JAVA_OPTS={{ java_system_properties }}"

# Modify the next two lines to specify the user to run the machine agent as. Note that
# you will need to ensure that:
# 1. The controller-info.xml in the agent conf directory is readable by this user
# 2. The logs directory is writeable by this user
# 3. The scripts directory is writeable by this user
User={{ appdynamics_user }}

# PIDFILE env var and the PIDFile property.)
