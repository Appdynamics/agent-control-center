    <!-- For a more detailed information on different configurations that an agent can support
    and the respective rules, one should reference following URL:
    https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO42/Java+Agent+Configuration+Properties
    In general configuration properties may be set in different ways. Here is the order
    of precedence how the agent will read and respect specific configurations.
      1. Environment Variables
      2. System Properties
      3. Version specific controller-info.xml. See .../$(Agent-Base-Install-Dir)/ver$(agent-version-no)/conf/controller-info.xml
      4. Default/Root controller-info.xml. See .../$(Agent-Base-Install-Dir)/conf/controller-info.xml -->

    <!-- This is the host name or the IP address of the AppDynamics Controller e.g. 192.168.1.22 or myhost or myhost.abc.com
    This is the same host that you use to access the AppDynamics browser based User interface.
    This can be overridden with an environment variable 'CONTROLLER_HOST_NAME' or
    the system property '-Dappdynamics.controller.hostName' -->
    <controller-host>{{ controller_host_name }}</controller-host>

    <!-- This is the http(s) port of the AppDynamics Controller , If 'controller-ssl-enabled' below is set to true, you must
    specify the HTTPS port of the Controller, otherwise specify the HTTP port. The default values are 8090 for HTTP and 8181 for HTTPS
    This is the same port that you use to access the AppDynamics browser based User interface.
    This can be overridden with an environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_CONTROLLER_PORT' or
    the system property '-Dappdynamics.controller.port' -->
    <controller-port>{{ controller_port }}</controller-port>

    <!-- This specifies if the AppDynamics agent should use SSL(HTTPS) to connect to the Controller. If you set this to true,
    the controller port property above should be set to the HTTPs port of the Controller.
    This can be overridden with an environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_CONTROLLER_SSL_ENABLED' or
    the system property '-Dappdynamics.controller.ssl.enabled' -->
    <controller-ssl-enabled>{{ enable_ssl | lower }}</controller-ssl-enabled>

    <!-- If this value is set to true, it indicates all the passwords and access-keys must be encrypted.
    If this value is false or undefined, passwords and access-keys will be in plain-text.
    One must reference following URL for the process and guidelines of encrypting passwords:
    https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO42/Java+Agent+Configuration+Properties -->
    <use-encrypted-credentials></use-encrypted-credentials>
    <!-- Full qualified path name for the SCS-KeyStore file name. -->
    <credential-store-filename></credential-store-filename>
    <!-- Password for the 'Secure Credential Store' (SCS). This password must be obfuscated. -->
    <credential-store-password></credential-store-password>

    <!-- If the AppDynamics Controller is running in multi-tenant mode or you are using the AppDynamics SaaS Controller
    you must specify the account name and account access key for this agent to authenticate with the controller.
    If you are running in single-tenant mode (the default) there is no need to configure these values.
    This can be overridden with an environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_ACCOUNT_NAME' or
    the system property '-Dappdynamics.agent.accountName' -->

    <account-name>{{ account_name }}</account-name>

    <!-- This can be overridden with an environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY' or
    the system property '-Dappdynamics.agent.accountAccessKey'
    This account-access-key must be encrypted if 'use-encrypted-credentials' is set to true -->
    
    <account-access-key>{{ account_access_key }}</account-access-key>
</controller-info>
